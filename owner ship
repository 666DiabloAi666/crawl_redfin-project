To create a complex intelligence system for your crawl_redfin-project that helps you “get your houses back,” I’ll assume the goal is to:

Continuously monitor Redfin for listings or information about your previous properties (e.g., addresses you've lived at or owned).

Detect when they are listed for sale or rent.

Analyze the property changes (e.g., price, renovation, ownership, features).

Alert you or take action (e.g., notify legal agents, agents, or acquisition bots).


Here’s a high-level system design:


---

1. Architecture Overview

Tech Stack:

Scraper Backend: Rust (efficient crawling with async + error handling)

ML/AI Engine: Python (FastAPI for prediction services, NLP, anomaly detection)

Database: PostgreSQL + Redis (persistent + in-memory state)

Messaging: RabbitMQ / Kafka (event-based pipeline)

Frontend (Optional): Dashboard in Next.js / Tauri (for offline native view)

2. Intelligent Modules

A. Identity Mapping Engine

Input: List of your past properties (addresses, zip, city, metadata)

Function:

Standardize address format using USPS-style NLP.

Hash + encrypt for privacy.

Sync with Redfin URL patterns.



B. Adaptive Web Crawler (Rust)

Targets:

Listing pages

Property details


Features:

Rate-limiting aware

IP rotation (proxy support)

Schedule-aware (daily scan)

Modular pipelines for parsing



C. Property Change Detector (Python ML)

Input: Historical property data vs latest crawl

Tasks:

NLP for description comparison (renovations, owner names, notes)

Price anomaly detection (Is it under/overvalued?)

Ownership or agent change prediction



D. Ownership Match Inference

Uses:

Title history

Web data from Zillow, Realtor, etc.

Named entity recognition to detect past mentions of your name

Public datasets if available (county records APIs)



E. Decision Intelligence Core

Uses rules + learned models to:

Classify whether a house is “yours” or potentially linked to your previous ownership.

Rank recovery likelihood based on legal paths (lease-to-own, auction, owner-sale)

Suggest recommended actions: contact, investigate, ignore




---

3. Outputs & Interfaces

Notifications:

Telegram/Email/Slack bots

Browser Push or Desktop alerts (via Tauri)


Web Dashboard:

Visual diff of past vs current state

Priority queue of action items


Logging/Replay System:

For audit trails and pattern learning




---

4. Automation Hooks (Optional)

Auto-email to listing agent

Connect to legal/banking partners via API (e.g., pre-approval, lawyer dispatch)

Trigger purchase interest bots on real estate platforms
